# Weather Monitoring System

## Overview
This project is a real-time weather monitoring system that retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for various metros in India. It calculates daily weather summaries, including average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and dominant weather conditions. The system also provides alerting features for specified weather conditions.

## Features
- Fetch real-time weather data for multiple cities.
- Calculate daily aggregates: average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and dominant weather condition.
- Store daily summaries in a CSV file.
- Send email alerts when specific temperature thresholds are exceeded.
- Configurable settings for data retrieval and alert thresholds.
- Visualizations for weather trends (to be implemented).

## Getting Started
